        <ol>
            <li style="text-align: left;"><strong>What is PauzR?</strong><br /> Created to reduce phone addiction and
                improve concentration, PauzR rewards users every day for keeping the phone locked successfully for
                durations provided in the app.</li>
            <li style="text-align: left;"><strong>How does PauzR work?</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><img
                src="https://api.pauzr.com/storage/uHnaiUkb2qkoE4jCq9lk2Y8AYu5xUX63LG28wHQj.jpeg" alt="" width="181"
                height="321" /><br /> <br /> PauzR will track the time for which the timer (20 or 40 or 60 minutes)
            inside the app was on. For successful 20 minutes, 1 point; for 40 minutes, 3 points; for 60 minutes, 5
            minutes are added to the account.</p>
        <ol style="text-align: left;" start="3">
            <li><strong>How do I invite friends?</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the side menu, you can click on &lsquo;Invite and Earn&rsquo; and select friends
            you want to invite. If your friend uses the link shared by you to download the app, you both will get 5
            points. There is no limit to number of friends you want to invite.</p>
        <ol style="text-align: left;" start="4">
            <li><strong>What is Scoreboard?</strong><br /> <img
                    src="https://api.pauzr.com/storage/bvvBBpftsE98CTqSnoQPHzXl4V1q5cGMd5l8Bx1v.jpeg" alt="" width="200"
                    height="356" /> <br /> Scoreboard displays leaderboard for Today, This Week, and This Month for your
                selected city. Your rank will be displayed along with other PauzR users of your city based on the time
                the timer sessions were successfully completed. Please note, Scoreboard only takes into account the
                total time the timer session was completed by you and other users. It does not take into consideration
                how many points you have earned.</li>
            <li><strong>What is a successful timer session?</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Once the timer is started in the PauzR app, user must not leave the PauzR app.
            However, the user can lock the phone. Even if user leaves the PauzR app by mistake in the middle of the
            session, an immediate notification appears asking the user to continue the session. Clicking the
            notification takes the user back to the timer screen. The buffer time for user to return back to the screen
            is 5 seconds.</p>
